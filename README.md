# further work still in progress

A simple contacts app where a random robot face is generated for each contact. Accesses robohash.org API for generating robot faces, tachyons for styling, jsonplaceholder API for generating some users for demo and React.js is handling the front-end.

In-progress: trying to integrate Google Contacts API or an equivalent to test it as a real-time contacts application. 

To run the project:

1. Clone this repo
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm start`
